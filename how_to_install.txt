How to Install Light Finder + for Maya

1. Copy the entire light_finder_maya folder to a location accessible by Maya.
2. Open Maya and go to the Script Editor.
3. In the Python tab, paste the following code:

exec(open(r"path\to\light_finder_maya\LightFindr.py").read())

Replace 'path\to\light_finder_maya' with the actual path where you placed the folder.

4. Run the script. The Light Finder + window should appear.

Optional:
- Add the script to a Maya shelf for quick access.
- Make sure PySide2 is available in your Maya installation.
